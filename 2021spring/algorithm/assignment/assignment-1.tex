\begin{exercise}
Prove the K\"onig theorem: Let $G$ be bipartite, then cardinality of maximum matching = cardinality of minimum vertex cover.
\end{exercise}
% 证明二分图的最大匹配数等于最小点覆盖数

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

Let $mcard$ denote the cardinality of maximum matching, and $vcard$ denote the cardinality of minimum vertex cover.

\bigskip
\textbf{1. Proof that } $vcard \ge mcard$ .

Suppose $mcard = k$, and then there exists $k$ non-adjacent edges in $G$. To cover these edges, we need $k$ different vertices at least, which means $vcard \ge mcard$.

\bigskip
\textbf{2. Proof that } $mcard \ge vcard$ .

Suppose $vcard = k$, and $S = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k\}$ is the minimum vertex cover set. According to its definition, there exists $m (m \ge k)$ edges $E = \{e_1, \dots, e_m\}$, where $e_j$ is start with $v_i$ . 

Construct set $S' = \{ v'_{1}, \dots, v'_{k}\}$, where $e_j$ is end with $v'_{i}$ . Obviously, $e_j$ is the edge between $v_i$ and $v'_{i}$ , and $S \cap S'$ is a empty set. 

Construct graph $M = <S \cup S', E>$, it is obviously one of the matchings of $G$, whose cardinality is $k$. Therefore, $mcard \ge k$, that is $mcard \ge vcard$.

\bigskip
In summary, $mcard = vcard$, that means cardinality of maximum matching = cardinality of minimum vertex cover.



\begin{exercise}
Consider the algorithm \textbf{Negative-Dijkstra} for computing shortest paths through graphs with negative edge weights (but without negative cycles). 
\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{Negative-Dijkstra(G,s)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $w^*\leftarrow$ minimum edge weight in $G$;
\For{$e\in E(G)$}
\State $w'(e)\leftarrow w(e)-w^*$
\EndFor
\State $T\leftarrow$\textbf{Dijkstra}$(G',s)$; \\
\Return weights of $T$ in the original $G$;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Note that \textbf{Negative-Dijkstra} shifts all edge weights to be non-negative
(by shifting all edge weights by the smallest original value) and runs in $O(m+\log n)$ time.

Prove or Disprove: \textbf{Negative-Dijkstra} computes single-source shortest paths correctly in graphs with negative edge weights. To prove the algorithm correct, show that for all $u\in V$ the shortest $s-u$ path in the original graph is in $T$. To disprove, exhibit a graph with negative edges, with no negative cycles where \textbf{Negative-Dijkstra} outputs the wrong "shortest" paths, and explain why the algorithm fails.
\end{exercise}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

This algorithm is wrong. Assume that directed graph $G=<V, E>$, $V = \{A,B,C\}$, and $E = \{ e_{AB} = 8, e_{AC} = 5, e_{BC} = -10 \}$.

\begin{lstlisting}
  A -----------------+                   A -----------------+    
  |                  |                   |                  |
 (8)                (5)       ==>       (18)               (15)
  |                  |                   |                  |
  V                  V                   V                  V
  B ---- (-10) ----> C                   B ----- (0) -----> C
     Figure-1. G                               Figure-2. G'
\end{lstlisting}

According to \textbf{Negative-Dijkstra} algorithm, digraph $G$ should be transformed into $G'$ in Figure-2.
If we execute \textbf{Dijkstra}($G'$, A), it will output 2 shortest paths:

1. $(A, B)$: $A \rightarrow B$, whose length is 18.

2. $(A, C)$: $A \rightarrow C$, whose length is 15.

However, in the original graph $G$, the shortest path of $(A, C)$ is $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ (whose length is -2), not $A \rightarrow C$.

The reason why it does not work is that, the \textbf{Dijkstra} algorithm assumes that the length of the path is always increasing. Once a vertex is marked as "finished", the algorithm found the shortest path to it, and it will never update this vertex again.

However, in a graph with negative edges, the length of the path is not always increasing, such as $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$ in figure-1.

\begin{exercise}
Consider a weighted, directed graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges that have integer weights. A graph walk is a sequence of
not-necessarily-distinct vertices $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k$ such that each pair of consecutive vertices $v_i,v_{i+1}$ are connected by an edge. This is similar to a path, except a walk can have repeated vertices and edges. The length of a walk in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the edges in the walk. Let $s,t$ be given vertices in the graph, and $L$ be a positive integer. We are interested counting the number of walks from $s$ to $t$ of length exactly $L$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume all the edge weights are positive. Describe an algorithm that computes the number of graph walks from $s$ to $t$ of length exactly $L$ in $O((n+m)L)$ time. Prove the correctness and analyze the running time
\item Now assume all the edge weights are non-negative(but they can be 0), but there are no cycles consisting entirely of zero-weight edges. That is, for any cycle in the graph, at least one edge has a positive weight.\\
Describe an algorithm that computes the number of graph walks from $s$ to $t$ of length exactly $L$ in $O((n+m)L)$ time. Prove correctness and analyze running time.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Solution - 1}

This is a dynamic programming problem. We need to define a state equation and find the state transition relationship.

Label each vertex in the graph from $1$ to $n$. Let $dp[i, l]$ be the number of walks of length $l$ from vertex $s$ to vertex $i$. Then we have
$$
dp[i, l] = \sum_{w(j, i) \le l}^{(j, i) \in E} dp[j, l-w(j, i)]
$$
 
where $w(j, i)$ means the weight of edge $j \rightarrow i$.
 
The value $dp[t, L]$ is the number of walks from $s$ to $t$ of length exactly $L$ .

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{Graph-Walk($G, s, t, L$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Fill array $dp[1, \dots, n][0, \dots, L]$ with zero
\State $dp[s, 0] = 1$
\For{$l=1$ to $L$}
    \For{$i=1$ to $n$}
        \For{$(j, i) \in E$ and $w(j, i) \le l$ }
        \State $dp[i, l]$ += $dp[j, l-w(j, i)]$
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
\EndFor \\
\Return $dp[t, L]$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In the algorithm-2 above, $\forall{v} \in V$, we need to scan all the ingoing edge(s) associated with $v$, which needs time $O(m+n)$. And the algorithm repeat this for $L$ times (at most), thus the total time complexity is $O((m+n)L)$ . The correctness is obvious.


\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution - 2}

The only difference between question-1 and this question is that the length of edges can be zero here. If there $\exists (j,i) \in E, j \ge i$ and $w(j,i) = 0$, then $dp[i, l]$ depends on $dp[j, l]$. When we compute $dp[i, l]$, the value $dp[j, l]$ is still unknown.

Since there is no cycles consisting of entirely of zero-weight edges, we consider the subgraph $G'$ consisting of all the zero-weight edges in original graph, the topological ordering sequence of $G'$ must exist. So we can perform a topological sort on $G'$, get the topological sequence $topo\_seq$. Then we can iterate vertices in $topo\_seq$, which can guarantee that $dp[j, l]$ have already been computed when computing $dp[i,l]$ where $(j, i) \in E (j \ge i) $ and $w(j,i) = 0$ (vertex $i$ must be after vertex $j$ in the $topo\_seq$) .

\newpage

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{Graph-Walk($G, s, t, L$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Fill array $dp[1, \dots, n][0, \dots, L]$ with zero
\State $dp[s, 0] = 1$
\State $G' \leftarrow$ zero-weight edges of $G$
\State $topo\_seq \leftarrow$ topologicalsort($G'$) 
\State $total\_seq \leftarrow$ $topo\_seq$ + [$V$ - $topo\_seq$]
\For{$l=1$ to $L$}
    \For{$i$ in $total\_seq$}
        \For{$(j, i) \in E$ and $w(j, i) \le l$ }
        \State $dp[i, l]$ += $dp[j, l-w(j, i)]$
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
\EndFor \\
\Return $dp[t, L]$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The time complexity of topological sort is only $O(m+n)$, thus the total time complexity is still $((m+n)L)$ .


\begin{exercise}
The diameter of a connected, undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ is the length (in number of edges) of the longest shortest path between two nodes. Show that is the diameter of a graph is $d$ then there is some set $S\subseteq V$ with $|S|\leq n/(d-1)$ such that removing the vertices in $S$ from the graph would break it into several disconnected pieces.

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

Firstly, we show that such $S$ exists.

Suppose that $d$ is the diameter of $G$, which starts with $u$ and ends with $v$. Then BFS($G$, $u$) (searching starts at $u$) can obtain a BFS-Tree whose root is $u$. This BFS-Tree's height is $d+1$.

Let $S_i$ represent the vertices at level $i (1 \le i \le d+1)$ in BST-Tree, and we can have
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{d+1}{|S_i|} = n
$$

For all $S_i(1 \le i \le d+1)$, removing $S_i$ from $G$ can break $G$ into two disconnected components.

Secondly, we show that for all $S_i$, we have $|S_i| \le n/(d-1)$ .

Proof by contradiction. Suppose there is no such $S$ satisfying $S \subseteq V$ with $|S| \le n/(d-1)$, and $S$ can break $G$ into two disconnected components. Hence for any $S_i$ mentioned above, there must be $|S_i| > n/(d-1)$, which means
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{d+1}{|S_i|} > \frac{(d+1)n}{d-1} > n
$$

This is in contradiction with $\sum_{i=1}^{d+1}{|S_i|} = n$.

Therefore, the conclusion in original problem is always true.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Let $G$ be a $n$ vertices graph. Show that if every vertex in $G$ has degree at least $n/2$, then $G$ contains a Hamiltonian path.
\end{exercise}

\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

Assume that $G=<V, E>$, $|V| = n$, and $\forall{x \in V}, deg(x)$ represents the degree of vertex $x$.

When $n=1$ or $n=2$, the conclusion is obviously true.

Consider the case of $n \ge 3$ . Since $\forall{x \in V}, deg(x) \ge n/2$, hence $\forall{x, y \in V}$ and $x \not= y$, we have $deg(x)+ deg(y) \ge n$ . According to \textbf{Ore's theorem}, there must exist a Hamiltonian circuit in $G$. The Hamiltonian path is included in this circuit.


\begin{exercise}
Show how to find a minimal cut of a graph (not only the cost of minimum cut, but also the set of edges in the cut).
\end{exercise}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

(1) If $G$ is a undirected graph, we can use \textbf{Stoer-Wagner Algorithm} to get its global minimum cut.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{MiniCutPhase(G, $w$, $a$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $A \leftarrow \{a\}$
\While{$A \not= V$}
    \State add to A the most tightly connected vertex
\EndWhile
\State store the \textit{cut-of-the-phase}
\State shrink $G$ by merging the two vertices added last
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{MiniCut(G, $w$, $a$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textit{cur} $\leftarrow \{ \infty \}$ 
\While{$|V| > 1$}
    \State \textbf{MinCutPhase($G, w, a$)}
    \If{\textit{cut-of-the-phase} is lighter than \textit{cur}}
        \textit{cur} $\leftarrow$ \textit{cut-of-the-phase}
    \EndIf
\EndWhile \\
\Return \textit{cur}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Notice that there is a starting vertex $a$ in the beginning of \textbf{MinCut}. It can be selected arbitrarily.

\bigskip

(2) If $G$ is a directed graph, according to \textbf{Max-flow min-cut theorem}, the value of max flow equals capacity of min cut in any network (directed graph).

The function \textbf{MaxFlow} is actually \textbf{Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}, which is used to detect maximum flow from start vertex $s$ to sink vertex $t$ in a given graph. 

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{GlobalMinCutInDirectedGraph(G)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $mincost, cutset \leftarrow$ $\infty, \{\}$
\For{$s \in V$}
    \For{$t \in V - \{s\}$}
        \State $mincost, cutset \leftarrow$ MaxFlow(G, $s$, $t$)
    \EndFor
\EndFor \\
\Return $mincost, cutset$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{MaxFlow(G, $s$, $t$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Start with empty flow: $f(e) = 0, \forall{e \in E}$;
\State Initialize residual network: $G_f$ = $G$;
\State $p \leftarrow$ search for directed path in $G_f$ from $s$ to $t$
\State $mincost \leftarrow \infty$
\While{$p$ exists}
    \State $D_f$ = $\min\{c_f(e), e \in p\}$
    \For{$\forall{e \in p}$}
    \If{forward($e$)}
    \State $f(e)$ += $D_f$
    \EndIf
    \If{backward($e$)}
    \State $f(e)$ -= $D_f$
    \EndIf
    \State $mincost$ = $\min\{mincost, f(e)\}$
    \EndFor
    \State update $G_f$
    \State $p \leftarrow$ search for directed path in $G_f$ from $s$ to $t$
\EndWhile \\
\Return $mincost, f$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\begin{exercise}
Let $G(V,E)$ be a connected undirected graph with a weight $w(e)>0$ for each edge $e\in E$. For any path $P_{u,v}=<u,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_r,v>$ between two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$,let $\beta(P_{u,v})$ denote the maximum weight of an edge in $P_{u,v}$. We refer to $\beta(P_{u,v})$ as the \textbf{bottleneck weight} of $P_{u,v}$. Define
\begin{displaymath}
\beta^*(u,v)=\min\{\beta(P_{u,v}):P_{u,v}\text{ is a path between $u$ and $v$}\}.
\end{displaymath}
Give a polynomial algorithm to find $\beta^*(u,v)$ for each pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in $V$ and a proof of the correctness of the algorithm.
\end{exercise}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

We can modify \textbf{Dijkstra Algorithm} to solve this problem. Let $d(v)$ denote the minimum bottleneck weight, which is $\beta^*(s, v)$ . Then we can have
$$
d(v) = \min(d(v), \max(d(u), weight(u, v)))
$$
where $\forall{u \in U}$ and $v \in V-U$, $U$ is the vertices set that minimum bottleneck weight has been figured out.

\newpage

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{$\beta^{*}$($G,s,t$)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\For{$x \in V$}
    \State $d(x) = \infty$
\EndFor
\State $d(s) = 0$
\While{$V$ is not empty}
    \State $p \leftarrow $ vertex $t \in V$ with min $d(t)$
    \State remove $p$ from $V$
    \For{all outgoing neighbors $q$ of $p$}
        \State $d(q) = \min(d(q), \max(d(p), weight(p, q))$
    \EndFor
\EndWhile \\
\Return $d(t)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Correctness Proof}

Proof by induction.

When $n=1$ or $n=2$, it is obviously correct.

Assume that when $n=k$, set $S$ have recorded $k$ vertices' minimum bottleneck weight, which are correct.

Consider the case of $n = k+1$. Let $v$ denote the vertex the algorithm are handling. Suppose $d(v)$ is not the minimum bottleneck weight, then there must be $\exists u \notin S$ and it will let $w < d(v)$ occur in a path, which starts in $S$ and reaches $v$ through $u$.

However, according to the definition of equation $d(x)$, we have $d(v) \le d(u)$. For the minimum bottleneck weight of the path passing through $u$, there must be $w > d(u) \ge d(v)$. This is in contradiction with $w < d(v)$ mentioned above.

So far, the correctness of the algorithm has been proved.


\begin{exercise}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph. Give a linear-time algorithm that given $G$, a node $s\in V$ and an integer $k$ decides whether there is a walk in $G$ starting at $s$ that visits at least $k$ distinct nodes.
\end{exercise}

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Solution}

If $G$ is a DAG, then the problem is equivalent to find a path starting at $s$ with $k$ different vertices. This can be solved by DFS or BFS, searching from vertex $s$ . Time complexity is $O(k)$ .

Otherwise, there exists a cycle in $G$, and $G$ will have a similar subgraph as follows. In this case, DFS/BFS will fail.
\begin{lstlisting}
             +----- ... ----+
             |              |
             V              |
s -> ... -> v[i] -> ... -> v[j] -> ...
             |
             V
            v[k] -> ...
\end{lstlisting}

Use \textbf{Tarjan Algorithm} to find out all the strongly connected components in $G$. Let $SSC_x$ denote the strongly connected component where vertex $x$ is in.
If we do DFS($s$) or BFS($s$) starting with $s$, then when traversing to a vertex $x$, it can go through all the vertices in $SCC_x$, which will increase $|SCC_x|$ distinct nodes to the walk.

This will also work in a DAG, because every single vertex is a strongly connected component in DAG.


\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{check-k-walk(G, s, k)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $seq \leftarrow$ \textbf{BFS}(G, $s$)
\State $SCC \leftarrow$ \textbf{tarjan}(G)
\State $walk \leftarrow$ 0
\State $reached \leftarrow$ \{\}
\For{$x$ in $seq$}
    \If{$x \notin reached$ }
    \State $walk$ += $|SCC_x|$
    \State $reached \leftarrow reached \cup SCC_x$
    \EndIf
\EndFor \\
\Return $walk \ge k$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Time complexity analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item BFS($s$) will cost $O(V)$.
    \item \textbf{Tarjan Algorithm} will cost $O(V+E)$ .
    \item There are $V$ elements in $seq$ at most, thus the \textbf{for} loop will cost $O(V)$ .
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the total time complexity is $O(V+E)$ .


\begin{exercise}
\textbf{Minimum Bottleneck Spanning Tree}: Given a connected graph $ G $ with positive edge costs, find a
spanning tree that {minimizes the most expensive edge}.
\end{exercise}

MBST problem can be solved by \textbf{Camerini's Algorithm}.

Assume that $G=<V, E, W>$, $|V| = m, |E| = n$.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\caption{MBST(G)}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $n \leftarrow |E|$
\If{$n = 1$}
    \Return E;
\Else 
    \State $sorted\_edges \leftarrow $ sort $E$ by increasing weight order
    \State $A \leftarrow$ $sorted\_edges[1, \dots, n/2]$
    \State $B \leftarrow$ $E-A$
    \State $F \leftarrow$ forest of $G_A$
    \If{$F$ is connected}
        \Return MBST($G_A$)
    \Else
        \State Combine components in $G_A$
        \State \textbf{return} $E_A$ + MBST($G_B$)
    \EndIf
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Time complexity analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sorting operation will cost $O(E\log{E})$.
    \item Finding forest in $G_A$ will cost $O(E)$.
    \item We can use \textbf{Disjoint-set} to judge whether if $F$ is connected and combine each component, which cost $O(E)$ time.
    \item The sub-MBST recursion calls will reach $T(E/2)$, according to \textbf{Master Theorem}, $T(E) \le cE + T(E/2) \Rightarrow T(E) = O(E)$.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the total time complexity of algorithm above is $O(E\log{E})$.
